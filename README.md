## Abstract
With the advent of the internet, cell phones, computers, and air travel. We see that the world view is becoming smaller. Issues in one country can have an impact on a neighboring country or a country across the ocean. An unhappy country can affect their internal stability as well as the world. It is therefore important to understand what affects the happiness of a country. Third World countries are most vulnerable in the happiness arena. This is why this study will concentrate on these countries and how young people affect the overall happiness of a country. Third World countries have a higher and increasing population of young adults. Data for this study was collected from the Databank.WorldBank.Org [Ref 1]. The study undertaken used machine learning regression models to answer the question whether more young adults in a country can predict a higher happiness score for the country. Though there was indication that the percentage of young adults did affect the happiness  score of a country, this affect was less than 10%.
